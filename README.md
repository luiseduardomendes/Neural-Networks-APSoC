# Neural Networks on APSoC
Developing Fault Tolerance Techniques on Neural Networks for new All Programmable System on Chip (APSoC) technologies

 * Study around the vulnerability on new APSoC technologies working on hostile envoronments focusing on spacial application.
 * Fundamental topics:
   * Computational Vision
   * Image Processing
 * Working:
   * Networking training and Conception
   * Inference and measurement
   * Topology Selection

## First works:
 [] Selection of a FPGA AMD Xilinx board
 [] Setting up the environment on the working station
 [] PetaLinux Installation
 [] Implementation of the neural networks demo application
 [] Data collection
 [] Acquirement and extaction of data from the data bases
 [] Conversion of the data to the PyTorch or TensorFlow Vitis AI
